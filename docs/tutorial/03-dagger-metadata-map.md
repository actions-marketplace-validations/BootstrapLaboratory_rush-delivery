# Dagger Metadata Map

Rush Delivery is configured by metadata in `.dagger`. The directory belongs to
the product repository, not to the Rush Delivery module, because target
behavior is product-specific.

A full Rush Delivery repository can use this layout:

```text
.dagger/
├── application-images/
│   ├── grype.yaml
│   └── providers.yaml
├── deploy/
│   ├── services-mesh.yaml
│   └── targets/
│       ├── server.yaml
│       └── webapp.yaml
├── package/
│   └── targets/
│       ├── server.yaml
│       └── webapp.yaml
├── release/
│   └── npm.yaml
├── rush-cache/
│   └── providers.yaml
├── toolchain-images/
│   └── providers.yaml
└── validate/
    └── targets/
        └── server.yaml
```

Each part answers one question.

Deploy-only repositories can omit `.dagger/release`. Package-only repositories
can omit `.dagger/deploy` and `.dagger/package`.

## Deployment Graph

`.dagger/deploy/services-mesh.yaml` answers:

- Which deploy targets exist?
- Which targets must run before other targets?

The example says `webapp` waits for `server`.

## Package Targets

`.dagger/package/targets/*.yaml` answers:

- What artifact does this target need?
- Is the artifact a Rush deploy archive, a built directory, or an OCI image?
- Which Rush project and deploy scenario produce it?

## Application Images

`.dagger/application-images/providers.yaml` answers:

- Which registry namespace receives application images?
- Which environment variable names supply registry and key-backed Cosign
  credentials?

An OCI package target can also reference
`.dagger/application-images/grype.yaml` as its explicit scanner ignore policy.
Filesystem-only repositories omit this directory. Provider `off` remains the
default and requires no application-image metadata.

## Deploy Targets

`.dagger/deploy/targets/*.yaml` answers:

- What runtime image should execute the deploy?
- Which files from the built workspace should be mounted?
- Which tools should be installed into the deploy runtime?
- Which environment variables may be passed?
- Which deploy script should run?

## Provider Artifacts

`.dagger/toolchain-images/providers.yaml` and
`.dagger/rush-cache/providers.yaml` answer:

- Where should reusable toolchain images and Rush install cache be stored?
- Which environment variables provide repository, token, and username?
- Which Rush install paths should be restored and published?

## Package Release

`.dagger/release/npm.yaml` answers:

- Which package release strategy should Rush Delivery use?
- Which target branch receives Rush version commits?
- Which npm registry, tag, access level, and token env should be used?

Package release metadata stays separate from deploy target metadata. Rush still
decides which packages are publishable and how change files affect versions.

## Validation Targets

`.dagger/validate/targets/*.yaml` answers:

- Which additional runtime services are needed for validation?
- Which commands or long-running services should start?
- Which smoke checks should prove the target works?

## Checklist

- Keep `.dagger` metadata small and declarative.
- Put provider credentials in CI env, not in metadata.
- Keep OCI registry and Cosign credentials in the Package environment; never
  place them in runtime files or deploy runtime allowlists.
- Put npm release credentials in release env, not deploy env.
- Put executable deployment behavior in scripts.
- Use metadata to connect Rush projects, package artifacts, and deploy targets.
